## Project

Name: Mattermost

URL: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server

Mattermost is an open source, private cloud, Slack-alternative.

## Onboarding experience

Did it build and run as documented?

See the assignment for details; if everything works out of the box,
there is no need to write much here. If the first project(s) you picked
ended up being unsuitable, you can describe the "onboarding experience"
for each project, along with reason(s) why you changed to a different one.

TODO: add more description
The first project we choose was Strongbox https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox, Strongbox is an OSS artifact repository manager with clear instructions (https://strongbox.github.io/developer-guide/building-the-code.html) on how to build the project. The project uses maven and all one had to do to build the project was to clone the repo and run ´´´mvn clean install´´´ in the repository. The project has an active community and we were in touch with the developers whom were ready to assist us. In the end the issue proved a bit too complicated and  we decided to change project.

The project we ended up working on was Mattermost. Mattermost have well documented information on how to run their project (https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/webapp/developer-setup/). There were no trouble in building the project.

## Effort spent for discarded project 5.5h per person
 ( https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox/issues/1398 )
For each team member, how much time was spent in

1. plenary discussions/meetings;
    Everyone: 1 hour

We found a project and issue that looked promising and proceeded to read documentation and set up.

3. reading documentation;
    Everyone: 45 min

4. configuration and setup;
    Everyone: 45 min

The project is rather large and took some time to set-up and some members had some issues that we had to figure out.
5. analyzing code/output;
    Everyone: 3 hour
We all went through the documentation and tried to understand the code. We realized the issue was a bit too complex for us and decided to find a new issue.

## Effort spent for project 2

For each team member, how much time was spent in

1. plenary discussions/meetings;

2. discussions within parts of the group;

3. reading documentation;

4. configuration and setup;

5. analyzing code/output;

6. writing documentation;

7. writing code;

8. running code?




For setting up tools and libraries (step 4), enumerate all dependencies
you took care of and where you spent your time, if that time exceeds
30 minutes.

## Overall experience

What are your main take-aways from this project? What did you learn?

Optional (point 6): How would you put your work in context with best software engineering practice?

Optional (point 7): Is there something special you want to mention here?
